## Work Experience
### Research Assistant @ Yale School of Management
July 2025 - Present
- Collaborated with a Yale economist to evaluate the effects of Euro currency adoption on capital flows. Main analysis compared volatility across different groups of data (Euro countries v. small open economies, Baltic countries before v. after Euro adoption) using data visualization and F-tests. Employed additional statistical tactics (RMSE, Half-life, Winsorization) and analyzed data from multiple sources to understand and explain the relationships among currency regimes, financial openness, and capital flow levels and volatility.
- Built a full-scale app with a user-friendly interface to complement research and allow for transparency and replication. Utilized a tech stack of R for data wrangling, Python and Streamlit for statistical tests, data visualization, and UI, and Claude Code and ChatGPT to streamline development. Full repo accessible above.
